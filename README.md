# ML Assignment – Regression & Classification

This is my machine learning assignment done using Google Colab. It’s divided into two parts:

## Part 1: Regression Models

In this part, I worked on predicting student math scores using:

- Multilinear Regression
- Polynomial Regression

I did data preprocessing, encoded categorical variables, selected features, trained the models, and compared their performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² score. I also discussed underfitting in the Polynomial Regression model based on the results.

## Part 2: Classification Models

In this part, I predicted whether a person would purchase a product based on their age and salary using:

- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (k=3, 5, 7)
- Decision Tree (Gini and Entropy)

I did preprocessing, standardized the features, trained all the models, and evaluated them using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. After comparing all models, I found that KNN with k=7 performed the best.
